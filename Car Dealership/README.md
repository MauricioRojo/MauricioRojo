## Description
This project was developed by a team of three, including myself. It is designed to replicate the basic functionalities of a car dealership system, allowing the dealership to keep track of sales, manage customers, update inventory, process refunds, and display all cars in the inventory along with other relevant details.

## Features
- **Inventory Management:** 
  - Admins, upon providing the correct credentials, can update the inventory of cars. This includes changing car prices, adding or removing cars from the inventory, and generating sales demographics based on new or old cars or by car type.
  
- **Refund Processing:** 
  - Customers can request a refund. If the purchase is verified in the `Ticket.txt` file, the refund is processed, and the inventory is updated accordingly.
  
- **Customer Management:** 
  - Admins can add new customers to the system by providing basic information. Customers can also apply for a membership, which grants them a discount on purchases. If a user doesnâ€™t have a membership, the discount will not be applied.

- **Car Filtering:** 
  - Users can filter cars by various criteria, including availability of new or used cars. The system displays cars based on the user's preferences.

- **Data Storage:** 
  - User information and car inventory are stored in CSV files. If the CSV files are unordered or misaligned, the system automatically sorts the columns for easier access, eliminating the need to manually search each column name.
